## Describe your work

I developed a simple banking app called Veegil Banking App with the Veegil Logo as the app icon
In order to use the app you have to login or register using your phone number and password.
Of cause since both the login and registeration are done using only phone number and password, I used the same page/screen for both the login and registeration. but if they where different then i would have used different screens.
After the user logs in or registers, he/she can access the dashboard where he/she can access the following:

- View their account balance
- View their account history/transactions visually using a line chart which shows the transactions in the last 7 days.
- View their account history/transactions
- Be able to make deposits and withdrawals (Of course you can only make withdrawals if you have enough balance in your account & if the withdrawal phone number is yours)
- Be able to transfer money to other users

## how to run the application

In order to run the application, first

- download the folder as a zip file and open it using the IDE of your choice (preferably VSCode).
- Then in the folder terminal type "flutter pub get" and then "flutter run --release"
- But make sure you are connected to an android device or emulator.

Incase there is any problem, you can open the issue on the [github page](https://github.com/kcibdev/veegil_test) and i will try to resolve it.

The apk file can be found in the directory "./app-release.apk"
